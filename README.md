This is a simple recipes project where I list and describe some of the best African recipes. In this project, I used only HTML programming language and at the end, I would have demonstrated the use of the following HTML elements:
<p>, this stands for paragraph element.
<a>, this stands for anchor element.
<h1> to <h2>, this stand for the 6 levels of heading in HTML
<img>, this stands for image element
