        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Banga(palm nut fruits)</li>
            <li>Medium size cat fish or tilapia fish</li>
            <li>Beef or chicken meat</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Season</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Cameroon pepper</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>banga_spices</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the palm nut fruits in a pot and add some water to the pot and place it in a source of heat. This is usually the first stage  and a very important stage at that.
            Ensure that you wait for about 10 minutes from the moment the water covering the palm nut has boiled. If its not properly steamed, its will be difficult to extra sufficient  palm nut_cream from the palm_kernel.
            </li>
            <li>The next stage is to transfer the nut into a mortar and pound gently. While pounding, ensure that you do it gently otherwise you will break up the palm kernel; which will result in a very tedious
            and painstaking process of extracting the nut-cream.
            </li>

            <li>The next stage is to pour hot water into the pounded nuts, squeeze it and use a sieve to strain our the extract. Repeat this process a couple of times until there is no more extract from the nut.
                
            </li>
            <li>Next is to pour the extract from the mortar into a pot and boil it until its thickened.
                When it has thickened, the oil will rise to the top of the pot. Then you should add your proteins:
                chicken or beef, cat fish or tilapia fish, marine proteins -crab, oyster, prawn.
            </li>
            <li>The final stage is to add your spices and seasoning. Your soup is ready and its "yomi-yomi" as anticipated</li>
        </ol>
