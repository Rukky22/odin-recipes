        The African vegetable soup is one of our favorite meals in Africa. It is normally prepared with some combination fo greenish vegetables: fluted pumpkin leave locally known as "Ugu leave", "Eru leave" wild spinach locally known as Afang leave, dandelion green leave locally known as "Efo Yamrin", beef or chicken, dried fish or stock fish, and a host of other ingredients. Its usually greenish brown in color, depending on the way the chef prepares it and a taste of it is guaranteed to be one of the most savory and delicious spinach recipes you will ever taste. Most people consume it with some form of solid moulded lump of cereal commonly known as "gary" or "fufu", though its more tasty when it is eaten with grain like rice. This Nigerian vegetable stew smoothies is best prepared and consumed within a day; there should be no left over for the next day. Whenever tourish visit the continent of Africa, its one of the best food they would love to introduced to their families when they go back home.
