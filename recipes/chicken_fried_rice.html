    <p>
        The chicken fried rice is a kind of celebratory dish for most families in Africa; irrespective of social class and financial status. Most occasion: wedding ceremony, traditional marriage rites and parties in generate will always go with the chicken fried rice. It is flavorful and filled with textures from crisp vegetable to super tasty lumps of fried chicken. I funly call it "African fried rice" because it is being prepared across the continent of Africa with almost the same ingredients; the only difference being the way and manner the chef processes it.
